# Reproduction code for 43128

I provide the converted model which runs slowly on Kirin 990 and conversion script.
The model is tf1/model.tflite, and the script is tf1/convert_tflite.py.

Please check the difference between the model and mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tflite, which run fast on Kirin 990.
